Usage: mobydam [-b bookfile] [-e dbdir] [-t exp] [-z] [-c host ] [-p port] [-f format] [-m msgfile] [-l logfile] [-o FEN]
Engine settings:
  -b bookfile = file name of opening book
       (default: book.opn)
  -e dbdir = directory holding database files
       (or multiple [semi]colon-separated directories)
       (default: current directory)
  -t exp = exponent of transposition table size, 20..30
       (default: 25 = 2^25 entries = 512MiB)
  -z = do pondering (search while awaiting opponent move)
DamExchange options:
  -c host = connect to host (dns name or ip address)
       (default: listen instead of connect)
  -p port = port number to use
       (default: 27531)
Log options:
  -f format = format of pdn log filenames
       %d in format is replaced by 0, 1, 2 or 3
       where 0=unknown, 1=loss, 2=draw, 3=win for engine
       (default: result%d.pdn)
  -m msgfile = DamExchange message log filename
       (default: dxp.log)
  -l logfile = engine output log filename
       (default: engine.log)
Profiling: (used during building of optimized version)
  -o FEN = position to search during 10s, then exit

draw         regulation draw ends game (toggle)
wipe         wipe transposition table before each game (toggle)
delay        short delay before first move (toggle)
depth <n>    set iterative search depth limit (0=no limit)
time <n>     set hard time limit per move (in ms) (0=no limit)
